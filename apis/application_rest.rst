HTTP REST API
======================================

General concept
--------------------------------

**Methods**

REST API uses JSON as serialization format and requires proper *Content-Type* and *Accept* headers in every client request.

API uses following HTTP verbs (methods):

- **GET** (collection) - retrieves collection,
- **GET** (item) - retrieves single item,
- **POST** (collection) - creates new item in collection,
- **POST** (item) - updates item,
- **DELETE** (item) - deletes item.

API **does not** support **PUT** since it is not possible to replace objects and **PATCH** which as we believe is commonly misunderstood and being used in wrong way (for updates).

**Linking**

CloudThing API implements great linking concept developed by awesome people at stormpath.com.
Every response (collection or object) is identified by its URL in *"href"* field, there is no other *id* provided. All relations between objects use this method and embed *href* in JSON object named as relative. It is possible to expanding relations in single request (one level only) by providing relation name to *expand* parameter in query.

In short words:

Just hit /api/v1/ and start exploring!

**Host**

HTTP API accept only encrypted (TLS) requests. All HTTP non-TLS requests will be redirected.
**Note that your credential still be exposed if you use plain HTTP!**

The HTTP server listens on standard port 443 of tenant's virtual host.

**Authentication**

CloudThing API supports Basic and Bearer (JWT) authentication. Basic auth needs:

- Username: {apiKey} or {userEmail},
- Password: {apiSecret} or {userPassword}.

To obtain JWT token one should send POST request to */api/v1/auth/token* endpoint with Basic auth.
